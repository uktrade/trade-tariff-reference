Hi Matt,  

To follow on from our call yesterday, I have some instructions for those extra pesky Moroccan entry price goods.  

Where the Moroccan agreement sets its own reference price for certain goods we will use a formula like so:  

“Entry Price – x% + Specific x% Rebased Price P“

Where, for each good “P” is replaced with the specific reference price, e.g. Tomatoes:

1 Oct – 31 May: Entry Price - 0% + Specific 100% Rebased price €4.61/tonne

1 June – 30 Sep: 0% 

And have the below text in the reference document under the entry price section. **We will add in this text ourselves** once the ref doc has been produced. 

*Except where the words “rebased price” appear,  the second "Specific" percentage value is a percentage of the Standard  Rate of Import Duty specific component for the goods classified under  the relevant commodity code, in the relevant  row of the Tariff Table in Annex II of the Tariff of the United Kingdom  version 1.0 of xx yyy 2019*

*Where the words “rebased price” appear, the  second "Specific" percentage value is a percentage of the specific  component determined from P as follows:* 

- *if  the price of a particular consignment is 2 %, 4 %, 6 % or 8 % below the  agreed entry price P, the specific component shall be 2 %, 4 %, 6 % or 8  %, respectively, of P;*
- *if  the entry price of a particular consignment is below 92 % of the agreed  entry price P, the specific component bound in the WTO shall apply.*

I think, as you hoped, this is just a simple  change, where we add the “Rebased Price P” onto the equations for those  particular entry prices but we will need to check for seasons as I  believe **each good is seasonal**! 

Please do not let this take priority over fixing  the quota tables for Chile, Switzerland, ESA, Faroes and Israel from my  email yesterday!

Many thanks and happy to discuss on the phone if needed,

Hugo
